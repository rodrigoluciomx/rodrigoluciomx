# 👨🏽‍💻 About me:
  
<p>I consider myself a proactive person, I like to work with people, and listen to their advice and ideas in order to do better work. I'm very compromised with my self-development, to me is very important to be healthy and get a good life/work balance. </p>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer vision with embedded machine learning
