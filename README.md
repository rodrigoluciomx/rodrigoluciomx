## Hi, I'm Rodrigo Lucio 🫡
`Open to work`

# 👨🏽‍💻 About me:


<p>I am a mechatronics professional passionate about the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). My expertise lies in programming, with a focus on Python, C++, and Java for developing IIoT solutions, and Ladder Logic Diagram with PLC's. I am also diving into Artificial Intelligence to enhance industrial processes.</p>
<p>I consider myself a proactive person, I like to work with people, and listen to their advice and ideas in order to do better work. I'm very compromised with my self-development, to me is very important to be healthy and get a good life/work balance. </p>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning IIoT
